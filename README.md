0x1D. C - Binary trees

What is a binary tree?
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure with nodes limited to two children.

What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree enforces an order for the nodes based on their keys whereas a binary tree does not have any specific ordering.


What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
Binary search tree provide faster insertion, deletion and searching operations than linked list.


What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
The depth of a node is the number of nodes between a specific node and the root node.
The height of a node is the maximum number of edges from the leaf node to the specified node,
whereas, the height of the root is the height of the entire tree.
The size of a binary tree is the total number of nodes in the tree.


What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree?


What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree?
**Complete binary tree**
In complete binary tree, all levels except possibly the last are completely filled and all nodes are as left as possible.
**Full binary tree**
In full binary tree, every node has either zero or two children.
**Perfect binary tree**
In perfect binary tree, all nodes (internal nodes) have two children and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.
**Balanced binary tree**
